CS465 Full Stack Development with MEAN


***Architecture***

- Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Express HTML and JavaScript were both used to create static pages and to add dynamic behaviors of the application. Express provides a robust way to handle routes and serve HTML content efficiently. The Single-Page Application (SPA) was adopted to improve the user experience by loading in content dynamically without having to refresh the page. This was implemented using frontend framework and a library. This helped to enable a smoother transition and create faster interactions. SPAs, unlike Express HTML and JavaScript are ideal for more complex and dynamic applications where you want the user to have a seamless experience. SPAs often require more setup initially but overall provide a more interactive and faster user experience.
  
- Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was chosen due to its flexibility in handling unstructured data, scalability, and the ease of integration with JavaScript through JSON. MongoDBâ€™s document heavy structure aligns well with agile development practices which in turn allows for more rapid iteration and schema evolution.  


***Functionality***

- How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write and allows for the machines to parse and generate more easily. JavaScript is a programming language where JSON is simply a format for structure data. JSON is crucial in tying together frontend and backend development. It allows for a seamless data exchange between the client and the server. 
  
- Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I created reusable UI components to replace HTML elements for consistency and efficiency. I also optimized API calls to reduce redundancies. This allowed for condensing of the code into smaller components to stay in line with the principles of Separation and Concerns. 


***Testing***

- Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In full stack application methods refer to HTTP methods used in API requests. These methods determine the type of action you want to perform. The methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These form the basis of RESTful API design which in turn allows clients to interact with the server in a structured way. Endpoints are specific URLs in a web application where the methods are applied. Each endpoint corresponds to a certain function or resource within the application. Endpoints are structured to reflect the applications resources. They are designed to be intuitive making it easier for developers to use the APIs correctly. Security is a crucial aspect of full stack development. To keep user data protected from unauthorized access is key. The use of passwords and Tokens is highly recommended to protect data. You should also determine who gets what authorization and what that user is allowed to do within the application. Also, adding in input validation can help to prevent SQL injection attacks. 


***Reflection***

- How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This course has contributed to my development as a software engineer by enhancing developing my full stack skills. These include Frontend development, Backend development, and security. Each level of these skills is going to be vital in my professional development. I need more practice with some aspects of full stack however, I am excited to get creating with my own ideas of web applications.  I think the skills and experience I have gained from this class and project is going to help make me a more competitive candidate in the job market when I am fully done. The ability to develop secure, scalable, and efficient full stack applications are highly valued in this industry.
